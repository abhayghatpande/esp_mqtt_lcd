# esp8266_pcd8544
PCD8544 LCD driver for esp8266 (Nokia 5110 &amp; 3110 display)

This is a direct port of code found at [arduino playground.](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PCD8544)

This git repository now only contains the the driver, the example code that used to be here is now moved to [pdc8544_example.](https://github.com/eadf/esp8266_pcd8544_example)

I have tested this with sdk v0.9.5 and v0.9.4 (linux & mac makefile)
